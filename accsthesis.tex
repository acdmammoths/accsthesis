% A template for typesetting an honors thesis in the Computer Science Department
% at Amherst College.
%
% By design, it is very minimal and only includes packages that are used for the
% formatting.
%
\documentclass[11pt,twoside,openright]{report}
% 11pt: Set 11pt font size
% twoside,openright: start chapters on right-hand pages (openright requires
% twoside. We undo the effects of twoside by using the geometry package.)

%% Required packages: do not remove or change %%
\usepackage[hmargin=1in,vmargin=1.25in]{geometry} % Set horizontal margins to 1
% inch, and vertical margins to 1.25in. Setting the horizontal margins to the
% same value undoes the effects of the twoside class option, which should be
% fine because theses are rarely bound these days, which is what twoside is
% really for.
%
% Use nice fonts, inspired by the ACM 'acmart' class.
\usepackage{libertinus} % libertinus for text
\usepackage{inconsolata} % inconsolata for math
%
% Package used to set double spacing
\usepackage{setspace}
%% End of required packages %%

%% Fill the following four lines: it's all you need to do
\author{Student Name}
\title{Thesis Title}
\newcommand{\classyear}{2021} % Your class year
\newcommand{\advisor}{Advisor Name} % "Prof." will be added by the style.

\usepackage{lipsum} % Remove this package when you start writing

\begin{document} % Let's go!

Your abstract here (1 page at most)

\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements are optional

Thanks, John von Neumann!

\tableofcontents % Required ToC after abstract and acknowledgements

\doublespacing% Use double spacing in the main text

\chapter{Your First Chapter Title in Title Case}
\pagenumbering{arabic} % Use Arab numbers for the main body pages. This command
                       % must be here otherwise the ToC gets arabic page numbers

\lipsum% Remove this when you start writing.

\bibliographystyle{plain} % Use the ``plain'' bibliography style. If you are
% fancy and want to use the natbib package (you should), remember to change this
% to ``plainnat''.

%\bibliography{thesisRefs} % Replace with your BibTeX file name and uncomment.
